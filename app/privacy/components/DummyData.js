# VINEVOLT REFUND POLICY

*Last Updated: April 26, 2025*

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Thank you for choosing Vine Mobility and Technologies Ltd ("Vine Mobility", "we", "us", or "our"). This VineVolt User Refund Policy ("Refund Policy") supplements our Terms of Service and outlines the circumstances under which Vine Mobility may issue a refund of EVCS Usage Fees to Users.

## 2. TERMINOLOGY

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Refund Policy will have the meanings ascribed to them in the Terms of Service.

## 3. SCOPE OF REFUND POLICY

This Refund Policy applies to EVCS Usage Fees that are collected by Vine Mobility from Users on behalf of a Site Host that are then processed by Vine Mobility or its Payment Processor. This Refund Policy does not apply when EVCS Usage Fees are collected directly by a Site Host. The goal of this Refund Policy is to help Users and Site Hosts resolve issues efficiently when discrepancies arise during charging sessions.

We will provide you with written notice of our decision to issue a refund upon receipt of your request for a refund.

## 4. ELIGIBILITY

Generally, it is Vine Mobility's policy that all EVCS Usage Fees paid by Users are non-refundable. However, Vine Mobility may, but is not required to, issue a refund to Users in its sole discretion.

The following are examples of where Vine Mobility may, but is not required to, issue a refund to Users:

### 4.1 EVCS Malfunction or Site Host Data or User Data Error
Vine Mobility may, but is not required to, issue a refund of EVCS Usage Fees to Users where Vine Mobility has validated a discrepancy between the actual charging session provided to the User and the charging session recorded or billed through the Network Services. This includes situations where the amount of the EVCS Usage Fee charged does not accurately reflect the charging session received due to a malfunction in the EVCS. Vine Mobility relies on charging logs to validate discrepancies without additional investigation or verification.

### 4.2 Price Rules and Customer Experience
Vine Mobility does not issue refunds to Users as a result of a misunderstanding regarding pricing rates or rules. Users are responsible for understanding the pricing rates and rules associated with each EVCS prior to initiating a charging session. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vine Mobility may, but is not required to, issue a refund to Users in the following circumstances:

#### 4.2.1 Time Plugged-in Charge
If a User did not know that they would be charged for time plugged-in instead of kWh consumption, the User may be eligible for a one-time refund. Vine Mobility will reject all subsequent requests for refunds from the User for the same time plugged-in charge issue.

#### 4.2.2 Idle Fees
Vine Mobility will not refund idle fees in all cases. However, refunds of idle fees may be considered in cases where significant hardware or software errors with the EVCS resulted in the idle fees or where Vine Mobility failed to provide the User with notification that idle fees would be applied; provided, however, that Vine Mobility will be deemed to have provided this notification where Vine Mobility provides the notification but the User has disabled the receipt of notifications from Vine Mobility.

## 5. REFUND PROCESS

### 5.1 Request Submission
Vine Mobility will not provide refunds for any refund requests not submitted within thirty (30) days of the User's payment of the EVCS Usage Fees. Vine Mobility will only process refund requests that are submitted using the contact form available on our website and that include the following documentation:
- The email address linked to the User's Account
- Detailed receipts or transaction proof
- Screenshots of actual charges
- Additional evidence supporting the claim, such as logs from the vehicle's application

### 5.2 Credit
Vine Mobility will credit any refunded amounts back to the original payment method used by the User to pay the EVCS Usage Fee being refunded.

## 6. ADDITIONAL TERMS

### 6.1 Site Host Refund Policies
This Refund Policy relates to the VineVolt Services only and does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any Site Host Agreement that you may have entered into with a Site Host that owns, operates, or otherwise controls a particular EVCS at a particular EVCS Location.

### 6.2 Pre-authorization Holds
Pre-authorization holds are released automatically. We cannot guarantee the timing of these refunds as it is dependent on a User's financial institution.

### 6.3 Financial Institution Fees
Any extra fees applied by a User's financial institution, such as transaction fees or service fees, are not eligible for refund.

## 7. MODIFICATIONS TO REFUND POLICY

We may modify this Refund Policy at any time by posting a revised version on our website or within the VineVolt Application, or by otherwise notifying you in accordance with the Terms of Service.
